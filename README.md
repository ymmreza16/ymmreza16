- ⚡ Fun fact: ☕️ I'm a coffee lover who enjoys exploring new and pure brews! When I'm not sipping on my favorite cup :) , you can find me glued to my computer for hours, diving into new languages and sharpening my skills. I'm pretty handy with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I absolutely love spending time in nature! 🌿
